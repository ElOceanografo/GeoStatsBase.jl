Solve a single realization of `var` in the simulation `problem`
with the simulation `solver`.

### Notes

By implementing this function, the developer is informing the framework
that realizations generated with his/her solver are indenpendent one from
another. GeoStats.jl will trigger the algorithm in parallel (if enough
processes are available) at the top-level `solve` call.
